Since the course began by using the Karel programming language, I have uploaded only the files written in C

PA3


For this PA, we had to implement "The Game of Trust" - a real life simulation of the prisoner's dilemma where users decide to cheat or play fairly or cheat on their turn. If player 1 and 2 both play fairly, the total reward is 2 per user; if player 1 cheats while player 2 plays fairly, or vice-versa, then player 1 will gain 3 points and player 2, 0; if both players decide to cheat, then neither player will be rewarded. Using my background in Economics, I was able to decide on an optimal strategy of playing tit-for-tat, where users play fairly from the start but punish their competitor if they cheat by cheating on the next turn. This strategy has been shown in Economic papers as being the optimal strategy for winning the prisoner's dilemma.
    



PA4


For this PA, we had to implement 3 different ciphers to encode and decode a message: the substitution cipher, the caesar cipher, and an enigma coder.




PA5 


For this PA, we simply created a playable version of the "Connect Four" game.
